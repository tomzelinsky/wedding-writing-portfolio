# Festival Wedding at Splotts Moor, Glastonbury

Confetti stuck in your boots. A veil tangled in fairy lights. A best man dressed like a druid.  
Some weddings aren't about doing it "right" – they're about doing it your way, mud and glitter included.

This one? A true festival wedding.  
No seating plan. No matching napkins. Just colour, chaos, and the kind of joy that can’t be rehearsed.

📍 Location: Splotts Moor, Glastonbury  
💍 Vibe: wild, musical, unapologetically free  
🎵 Soundtrack: live folk band + spontaneous chanting (yes, really)
